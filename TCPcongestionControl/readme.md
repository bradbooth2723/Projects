#Requirements
tcpAlmostVegas.py was designed to run alongside receiver.py and train.sh in the same terminal.  

#Description
train.sh adds delay to packets sent and received.  It also limits the buffer size.  Essentially it creates an artifial network.
tcpAlmostVegas.py is a congestion control algorithm that sends message.txt to receiver.py.
